Project Summary:
Built a machine learning pipeline to predict the popularity of songs on Spotify using a dataset of over 32,000 tracks (1957–2020), leveraging audio features such as danceability, energy, loudness, and valence. Conducted thorough EDA, handled multicollinearity, and applied multiple modeling approaches to maximize predictive performance.

Key Techniques Used:

1) Data preprocessing and feature engineering (standardization, interaction terms, transformations)

2) Model selection and comparison: Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting

3) Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and cross-validation

4) Evaluated models using R-squared, RMSE, and overfitting indicators

Results:

Gradient Boosting Regressor (tuned): Test R-squared ≈ 0.896, Training R-squared ≈ 0.874 — explaining over 80% of the variance in song popularity.

Outcome:

Demonstrated how feature interactions and advanced ensemble methods significantly outperform linear models in regression tasks involving skewed and complex data distributions. 
Proposed future work includes implementing a recommendation system and exploring classification-based approaches for genre prediction.
